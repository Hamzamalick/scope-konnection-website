      <p>
        The team at Scope Software Solutions work hard to make sure you have
        easy and efficient access to your personal data, but we’re also
        committed to keeping it safe. We employ multiple levels of security to
        your data, our systems and our networks.
      </p>

      <h2>Passwords</h2>
      <p>
        In order to protect your data, we start with the basics, with all
        devices and files password protected. Further to this, our internal
        password policy requires our staff to use strong, randomly generated
        passwords that are changed regularly, and to ensure they are kept safe,
        we use an industry standard password manager.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal / Confidential Information</h2>
      <p>
        When accessing client information, our staff follow a strict information
        disclosure policy, where the confidentiality of Client’s and Member’s
        personal data is held in highest regard. A copy of our policy is
        available on request.
      </p>

      <h2>Internal Security</h2>
      <p>
        Our internal security and systems are routinely checked via monthly
        internal security and penetration tests, and our overall codebase is
        updated and patched weekly, meaning any potential issues are proactively
        identified, isolated and remediated.
      </p>

      <h2>Hardware</h2>
      <p>
        All on-premise hard drives are encrypted at rest, meaning that in the
        event of a physical security issue, all data remains safely protected.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Centres</h2>
      <p>
        Our data centres are maintained and managed to the highest industry
        standards and have the following compliance certifications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ISO/IEC 27001:2013</li>
        <li>SOC3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, our security policy is supported by our data centres having
        the following policies and practices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Access to the data center floor is restricted to data center employees
          and authorized visitors
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Centers are staffed 24/7/365 with security guards and technicians
        </li>
        <li>
          All employees and visitors are identified using biometrics and ID
          checks before entering the facility
        </li>
        <li>HVAC and power have redundant back-ups</li>
        <li>
          Multiple Internet carriers using independent fiber connections ensure
          a failsafe connection to the cloud
        </li>
        <li>
          Our networks have redundant routers, switches, and service providers
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Updates to this Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may need to make changes to this Security Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will become effective as soon as they are posted to our
        website, or communicated by other means.
      </p>
